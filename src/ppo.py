        actor_critic: The constructor method for a PyTorch Module with a 
            ``step`` method, an ``act`` method, a ``pi`` module, and a ``v`` 
            module. The ``step`` method should accept a batch of observations 
            and return:

            The ``act`` method behaves the same as ``step`` but only returns ``a``.

                                           | If actions not given, will contain
                                           | ``None``.

        ac_kwargs (dict): Any kwargs appropriate for the ActorCritic object 
            you provided to PPO.

        seed (int): Seed for random number generators.

        steps_per_epoch (int): Number of steps of interaction (state-action pairs) 
            for the agent and the environment in each epoch.

        epochs (int): Number of epochs of interaction (equivalent to
            number of policy updates) to perform.

        gamma (float): Discount factor. (Always between 0 and 1.)

        clip_ratio (float): Hyperparameter for clipping in the policy objective.
            Roughly: how far can the new policy go from the old policy while 
            still profiting (improving the objective function)? The new policy 
            can still go farther than the clip_ratio says, but it doesn't help
            on the objective anymore. (Usually small, 0.1 to 0.3.) Typically
            denoted by :math:`\epsilon`. 

        pi_lr (float): Learning rate for policy optimizer.

        vf_lr (float): Learning rate for value function optimizer.

        train_pi_iters (int): Maximum number of gradient descent steps to take 
            on policy loss per epoch. (Early stopping may cause optimizer
            to take fewer than this.)

        train_v_iters (int): Number of gradient descent steps to take on 
            value function per epoch.

        lam (float): Lambda for GAE-Lambda. (Always between 0 and 1,
            close to 1.)

        max_ep_len (int): Maximum length of trajectory / episode / rollout.

        target_kl (float): Roughly what KL divergence we think is appropriate
            between new and old policies after an update. This will get used 
            for early stopping. (Usually small, 0.01 or 0.05.)

        save_freq (int): How often (in terms of gap between epochs) to save
            the current policy and value function.
